## Machine Learning Project 

# SPOTIFY PLAYLIST GENERATOR 

The project was based on a Spotify dataset with various audio features found on : https://github.com/kaytee124/SpotifyPopularity
The goal is to identify songs that are most similar to the selected track. To achieve this, I implemented and compared several recommendation techniques, including k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), dimensionality reduction with PCA, and autoencoders for latent feature extraction. 
The project highlights how different approaches capture musical similarity and influence the quality of the resulting playlist, which still remains quite subjective.
